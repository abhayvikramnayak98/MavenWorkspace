## Insights

- Many employees are doing a great job meeting expectations at their jobs.
- Employees feel cared for and motivated to do their best work every day.

- Hosting more social or networking events in the future is essential.
- Employees may appreciate more public recognition for their efforts. 
- Finding ways to showcase their skills while collaborating with the broader team can help keep staff motivated and engaged.

## Conclusion
