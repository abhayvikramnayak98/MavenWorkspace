## About This Project
Ever wondered which Halloween candies will make you the most popular house on the block? This project dives into candy data to uncover the top three treats guaranteed to make trick-or-treaters flock to your door!

## Goal
To use data and analytics to find the three ultimate Halloween candies that will win you the hearts (and sweet teeth!) of your neighborhood.

## Approach
1. *Explore the Data*: Loaded and visualized candy data in Python.
2. *Uncover Patterns*: Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to simplify and create a scatter plot for better insights.
